;                             Introduction
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Well, this is it! An example Profiler include, showing you how to create your 
; own Install profiles easily. This file uses Drupal's info format, which is 
; very similar to PHP's own ini format, however you can use nested arrays in 
; Drupal's version, which comes in handy for lots of stuff, as you'll see below.
;
; "Wait, you said this would be easy, what is all this stuff?"
;
; There aren't really any mandatory things here, but if you don't put anything 
; in here, your install profile won't do much. :) Don't get overwhelmed, just
; go slow and make a few changes here and there till you get the hang of
; what's happening.
;
; I've tried to create examples for every piece of functionality below, but to 
; get a quick breakdown of what's currently available, here's a list of all the 
; possible items:
;
; - base
; - dependencies
; - nodes
; - terms
; - theme
; - users
; - variables
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

name = Open Way Volunteer
old_short_name = standard
description = A Drupal distribution to create volunteer listings
core = 7.x
theme = open_way_2015


; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; You could specify this as a base Profiler include by using the following in
; your own Install profile's Profiler include. Then everything in this file
; would be merged with your Profiler include:
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; base = profiler_example

; and enabled automatically.

;                                  Variables
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; These variables should be pretty self explanatory, as they are just an array
; of key value pairs for items in the variable table. Nested arrays also can 
; crop up here, since variables can be arrays.
;
; Also, make note of the site_name and site_mail variables below. These 
; variables need to be set if you want to bypass the Configuration form during 
; installation (@see Users for more information on how this is accomplished).
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;variables[site_name] = Volunteer Center of Anytown
;variables[site_mail] = testing@testing

; options for default theme
;variables [toggle_logo] = 1
;variables [toggle_name] = 1
;variables [toggle_slogan] = 0
;variables [toggle_node_user_picture] = 1
;variables [toggle_comment_user_picture] = 1
;variables [toggle_main_menu] = 0

;variables [default_favicon] = 0

;variables [zen_breadcrumb_title] = 0
;variables [zen_rebuild_registry] = 0
;variables [zen_wireframes] = 0
;variables [favicon_mimetype] = image/gif

; You may also want to set the clean url variable if you don't need clean urls. 
; Since we bypassed the configuration screen, it is enabled by default, so to 
; disable it you'll want to uncomment this line:
; variables[clean_url] = 0
