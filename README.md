# open_way_volunteer
A Drupal install profile which allows for listing and search of volunteer opportunities

INSTRUCTIONS

On a server with webservices and Drush configured. A good, inexpensive option with Drush preinstalled is: http://www.site5.com/in.php?id=144583 (referal link)

On the system in bash terminal type:

drush make https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uwgnh/open_way_volunteer/master/open_way_volunteer_stub.make

or if you have downloaded this repository simply

drush make open_way_volunteer_stub.make

This command will download these files which will instruct drush to download all the modules and theme files.

Once this process is complete you can install Drupal and select the "Open Way Volunteer" option from the install menu.

You can see a demonstration which is intergrated into the general website at: http://www.uwgnh.org/volunteer/find

There is a short video walk through of the system at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_xa_sTMxUI

This is still a work in progress. 

TODO
Add theme elements and content by default so the new site is more atractive.
